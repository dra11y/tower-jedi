Hello, today we received task from the Empire. They asked to go thru the death star project and find any potential problems.

They asked to write it all down and hand them the report or even fix it ourselves if it's possible.

They also have heard about this amazing new shielding technology called `docker` and `docker-compose` and are wondering if you could create this for death star? And their storages are currently badly managed and they want to change to something called `PostresQL`. Have you heard about it?


The last thing they asked about was some sort of new tool that is used to terraform planets (at least i think so based on the name) `Terraform`. Do you think you can help them out with it?
